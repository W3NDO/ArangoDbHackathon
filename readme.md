# ArangoDB Hackathon Entry

In this entry, I attempt to build an anime recommendation system using ArangoDB and NetworkX in Python. 

The python notebook explains the process of data extraction, enrichment and reformatting in order to load it into the graph database Arango. 

Further, we add in similarity indices to help with recomendation.

The dataset is publicly available off of Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andreuvallhernndez/myanimelist)
